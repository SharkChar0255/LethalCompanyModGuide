Guide to modding Lethal for my boys (and girl in the future if girl exist??)

#### Quick & Comprehensive guide to how to install the mods you want to use on Lethal (for Penis Nuggets)

### Initial Setup 
# ⚠️ WARNING: (Only do this if you plan on downloading your mods through thunderstore, if not, skip to the Manual Install Section)
You'll need Thunderstore before anything else, to download it you simply need to 
- go to the thunderstore page (see the Downloads section for links)
- click the green button that says "Get App" <img width="1568" height="1444" alt="Thunderstore" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8a2fa5-5f13-4894-99df-72cbefb1dbea" />
- When you click get app, it'll take you to the overwolf appstore (Thunderstore is in the overwolf ecosystem of apps like OutPlayed and Forge) where from there, you can click get app on the bottom, where it should automate most of the installation for you (if you don't have overwolf, it will download overwolf for you.) <img width="1598" height="1720" alt="Overwolf" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8274c92f-e43e-42bf-82be-366ea155c91d" />

### Installing Mods
## Through Thunderstore (Recommended)
Installing mods through Thunderstore is fairly simple. Thunderstore is a storefront for mods with compatibility for a ton of games, but since we only want lethal company mods, we're only going to insatll lethal company mods.
- When you open Thunderstore, you'll see a bunch of games and a search bar, type 'Lethal Company' into the search bar and then 'Select Game' (P.S. You can also press the 'Set Default' button, this will just automatically load you in to the Lethal Company Mod Page when you open Thunderstore

- Now, Usually there's a few layers of setup you'd have to do with setting up a profile, but because I've already set one up for you, I'll just tell you how to import a profile. After you've selected Lethal Company in Thunderstore, you'll be brought to a screen similar to the image below, but it won't have any profiles available <img width="2676" height="1690" alt="TINSTALL 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311010c9-7c53-48d1-ba19-48f7262e3b02" />, You'll want to click 'Import/Update, and then, when it brings you to this screen <img width="1252" height="272" alt="TINSTALL 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce59211-3006-460c-b7f4-1947b1098a9d" /> click 'Import Code', and then enter this code **01982ab5-e3a1-ac56-030d-5f6b93ae2f59** and click continue.
