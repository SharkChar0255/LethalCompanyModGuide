# Quick guide on how to install mods for lethal

## Before you get started
Just note that, once you install mods, you MUST have the exact same mods as the people you're playing with to join their lobby. You will need to play the Vanilla version of Lethal Company if you want to play with someone not using mods 
- if you used thunderstore to install mods, simply click the **Vanilla** button while launching from any profile
- if you did it manually, you will have to remove your **plugins** folder and any mods you installed

## Initial Setup 
### ⚠️ WARNING: (Only do this if you plan on downloading your mods through thunderstore, if not, skip to the Manual Install Section)
You'll need Thunderstore before anything else, to download it you simply need to 
- go to the thunderstore page (see the Downloads section for links)
- click the green button that says "Get App" <img width="1568" height="1444" alt="Thunderstore" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8a2fa5-5f13-4894-99df-72cbefb1dbea" />

- When you click get app, it'll take you to the overwolf appstore (Thunderstore is in the overwolf ecosystem of apps like OutPlayed and Forge) where from there, you can click get app on the bottom, where it should automate most of the installation for you (if you don't have overwolf, it will download overwolf for you.) <img width="1598" height="1720" alt="Overwolf" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8274c92f-e43e-42bf-82be-366ea155c91d" />

## Installing Mods
### Through Thunderstore (Recommended)
#### Importing a profile
Installing mods through Thunderstore is fairly simple. Thunderstore is a storefront for mods with compatibility for a ton of games, but since we only want lethal company mods, we're only going to insatll lethal company mods.
1.  When you open Thunderstore, you'll see a bunch of games and a search bar, type 'Lethal Company' into the search bar and then 'Select Game' (P.S. You can also press the 'Set Default' button, this will just automatically load you in to the Lethal Company Mod Page when you open Thunderstore
<img width="2690" height="1710" alt="TINSTALL1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd33672d-7c6f-433f-874d-0e6e8ffdacbc" />
<img width="2676" height="1694" alt="TINSALL2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/076b6a41-bdf7-4792-b198-e79ff35c271d" />

2. Now, Usually there's a few layers of setup you'd have to do with setting up a profile, but because I've already set one up for you, I'll just tell you how to import a profile. After you've selected Lethal Company in Thunderstore, you'll be brought to a screen similar to the image below, but it won't have any profiles available <img width="2676" height="1690" alt="TINSTALL 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311010c9-7c53-48d1-ba19-48f7262e3b02" />

You'll want to click 'Import/Update, and then, when it brings you to this screen <img width="1252" height="272" alt="TINSTALL 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce59211-3006-460c-b7f4-1947b1098a9d" />

click 'Import Code', and then enter this code **01982ab5-e3a1-ac56-030d-5f6b93ae2f59** and click continue. It will then bring you to this screen, where you can download the mods by clicking 'Import' <img width="2688" height="1684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2694fa-ba70-4816-b39d-1c338cc88b05" />

3. Once you click 'import', it will ask you if you'd like to either 'Import new profile' or 'Update existing profile' <img width="1251" height="355" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece8c5e4-df44-41e6-b563-ffcceee19467" />

Click 'Import new profile' then give it a name (doesn't matter what the name is)

4. Once you've done this, you should now have a screen similar to this <img width="2676" height="1690" alt="TINSTALL 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/311010c9-7c53-48d1-ba19-48f7262e3b02" />

Click **Select Profile**, then, it should bring you to this screen <img width="1892" height="1685" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8b257b2-051e-492b-bc06-9610fac89c75" /> 

To start the game with the mods you've installed, simply click the blue **Modded** button at the top (*make sure steam is open before you press the button*). 

5. A command prompt will appear, let the command prompt run by itself (if it seems like it freezes at any point, thats normal, just let it run), and once the game opens, you are now running modded Lethal Company! If the game crashes, just launch repeat the step before and it should launch again correctly. You'll know the game is actually modded if the title screen changes from 'Lethal Company' to 'More Company' <img width="2878" height="1799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad2ea21-2528-4350-bf16-e0fe5bf0ddf8" />

#### Updating a profile
If new mods are added to a profile, you can update them by:
- Repeat steps 2-3, but instead of clicking 'import new profile', click 'update existing profile'. Then, select the profile you'd like to update, and continue. This will delete/download any relevant mods to the profile (be careful not to update the wrong profile, as this can completely overwrite your selected profile with mods from the profile you're importing.

#### Installing more mods
What I detailed before was how to import a file, but if you'd like to install mods yourself, here's how:
1. Either follow the steps prior to select a profile, or, create a new one by clicking 'Create New' <img width="1908" height="1484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86b03a50-c61f-44bd-a4b1-43f99e3e2f84" />

then entering a 'profile name', and selecting your newly created profile
##### NOTE: whichever profile's name is coloured blue is the profile that you'll load when you press **'select profile'**
2. Once you do this, you'll be brought to a screen showing all of your mods. Simply select 'Get Mods' from the side pane and then use the search bar to find the mod you want to install <img width="2702" height="1698" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db241b70-13de-42e2-85e1-143f65620d61" />

once you do that, simply select the mod you want to install, and click the 'download' button <img width="2618" height="1682" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d21e6096-0302-412d-bd20-80fe1fd0fa55" /> 

Once it's installed, you should see all of your installed mods pop up in the 'My Mods tab' 

### Manual Install
You can also download the mods manually. The initial downloads are less work than getting Thunderstore setup, however, downloading Mods after setup is significantly easier on Thunderstore then doing them Manually.

The reason we can install mods manually is because Thunderstore is just the Mod Manager, meaning all it does is just show you the mods you have installed, **BepInEx** is the actual mod loader for Lethal Company. 
1. To Install BepInEx, go the GitHubPage (linked in the downloads section) and scroll down to **Option 2: Download the Exe**, and then click the hyperlink to the 'releases page' <img width="1228" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f54fefc-d63e-4d46-b469-102ecfcd426b" />

2. It will download an installer for BepInEx (it is safe), run the installer, and follow the steps to install BepInEx for lethal company (be wary, the installer does contain ads in it, so if you receive ads for other applications, make sure to uncheck the 'download' boxes for the advertised apps before proceeding).
3. Now when you start the game, a command prompt will run before launching, indicating that BepInEx has been installed.
4. To actually download mods (for this example, we'll use MoreCompany, which is linked in the downloads section), go to the thunderstore page for your chosen mod, and scroll down until you find the *'Manual Download'* Button <img width="2868" height="1296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a289edae-a0fa-44a3-9cdd-4f4ad71d3883" />

5. Once you've click the button, you'll download a folder with a 'MoreCompany.dll' file inside. Navigate to your Lethal Company Install (on steam, click on the game in your library, then the Cog Icon -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Browse... <img width="2880" height="1696" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68789342-0443-43c3-8f3f-074246132843" />

6. Once you're here, BepInEx should've created a 'BepInEx' folder, which should have a 'plugins' folder inside (if not, make one), then, drag the 'MoreCompany.dll' file into the plugin folder. If you've done this correctly, the game should launch and the title screen should change from 'Lethal Company' to 'More Company' <img width="2878" height="1799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ad2ea21-2528-4350-bf16-e0fe5bf0ddf8" />

Do the same for any mods you'd like to install.
